<h4 id ="L">Lossy</h4>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">Lossy file compression results in lost data and quality from the original version.
        Lossy compression is typically associated with image files, such as JPEGs, but can also be used for audio files,
        like MP3s or AAC files. The "lossyness" of an image file may show up as jagged edges or pixelated areas.
        In audio files, the lossyness may produce a watery sound or reduce the dynamic range of the audio.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">Because lossy compression removes data from the original file, the resulting file often takes
        up much less disk space than the original. For example, a JPEG image may reduce an image's file size by more
        than 80%, with little noticeable effect. Similarly, a compressed MP3 file may be one tenth the size of the
        original audio file and may sound almost identical.</p>

            <p>You can notice how the uncompressed image (left) retains more pixels than the compressed image (right).
            This is shown by the noticeable difference in image quality, where the lack of pixels creates a more
                block-like and rough imagery than an uncompressed image. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

<h4 id ="LS">Lossless</h4>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p class="flow-text">Lossless compression reduces a file's size with no loss of quality. This seemingly magical
        method of reducing file sizes can be applied to both image and audio files. While JPEGs and MP3s use lossy
        compression, newer compression algorithms, such as JPEG 2000 and Apple Lossless compression, can be used to
        create lossless compressed files.</p>
    <p class="flow-text">Lossless compression basically rewrites the data of the original file in a more efficient way.
        However, because no quality is lost, the resulting files are typically much larger than image and audio files
        compressed with lossy compression. For example, a file compressed using lossy compression may be one tenth the
        size of the original, while lossless compression is unlikely to produce a file smaller than half of the
        original size.</p>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light">
            <img class="activator" src="losslessimage.png">
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
            <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Lossless Algorithm<i class="material-icons right">more_vert</i></span>

        <div class="card-reveal">
            <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Explanation<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
            <p>Ironically, this image is low-quality because it has been compressed.
                Regardless, it demonstrates how lossless files are formatted into an algorithm.
                In this case, the coloured squares could represent a small section of an image which is broken down into a numbered order.
                (e.g. 3 green squares is represented by 3 and a blue square adjacent is represented by 1, so that the number sequence becomes [3, 1].</p>
